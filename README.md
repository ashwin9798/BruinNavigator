# BruinNavigator
A map-based C++ application that recommends optimal directions from point to point in the Los Angeles area. Data was obtained from OpenStreetMaps, and was parsed with a self-designed C++ parser.
The navigation is optimized using A*, a path finding algorithm that recommends the shortest path based on a carefully chosen heuristic.
